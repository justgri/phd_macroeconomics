            "This book is about micro foundations for macroeconomics. Browning, Hansen,
                and Heckman (1999) identify two possible justifications for putting microfoundations
                underneath macroeconomic models. The first is aesthetic and preempirical:
                models with micro foundations are by construction coherent and explicit.
                And because they contain descriptions of agents' purposes, they allow us to analyze
                policy interventions using standard methods of welfare economics. Lucas
                (1987) gives a distinct second reason: a model with micro foundations broadens
                the sources of empirical evidence that can be used to assign numerical values
                to the model‚Äôs parameters. Lucas endorses Kydland and Prescott's (1982) procedure
                of borrowing parameter values from micro studies. Browning, Hansen,
                and Heckman (1999) describe some challenges to Lucas's recommendation for
                an empirical strategy. Most seriously, they point out that in many contexts the
                specifications underlying the microeconomic studies cited by a calibrator conflict
                with those of the macroeconomic model being ‚Äúcalibrated.‚Äù It is typically not
                obvious how to transfer parameters from one data set and model specification
                to another data set, especially if the theoretical and econometric specification
                differs.<br>
                Although we take seriously the doubts about Lucas‚Äôs justification for microeconomic
                foundations that Browning, Hansen and Heckman raise, we remain
                strongly attached to micro foundations. For us, it remains enough to appeal to
                the first justification mentioned, the coherence provided by micro foundations
                and the virtues that come from having the ability to ‚Äúsee the agents‚Äù in the
                artificial economy. We see Browning, Hansen, and Heckman as raising many
                legitimate questions about empirical strategies for implementing macro models
                with micro foundations. We don‚Äôt think that the clock will soon be turned back
                to a time when macroeconomics was done without micro foundations."

            "Recursive methods constitute a powerful approach to dynamic economics due
                to their described focus on a tradeoff between the current period's utility and a
                continuation value for utility in all future periods. As mentioned, the simplification
                arises from dealing with the evolution of state variables that capture the
                consequences of today's actions and events for all future periods, and in the case
                of uncertainty, for all possible realizations in those future periods. Not only is
                this a powerful approach to characterizing and solving complicated problems,
                but it also helps us to develop intuition, conceptualize, and think about dynamic
                economics. Students often find that half of the job in understanding how
                a complex economic model works is done once they understand what the set of
                state variables is. Thereafter, the students are soon on their way to formulating
                optimization problems and transition equations. Only experience from solving
                practical problems fully conveys the power of the recursive approach. This book
                provides many applications.<br>
                Still another reason for learning about the recursive approach is the increased
                importance of numerical simulations in macroeconomics, and most computational
                algorithms rely on recursive methods. When such numerical simulations
                are called for in this book, we give some suggestions for how to proceed
                but without saying too much on numerical methods."
